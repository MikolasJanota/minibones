\section{Introduction}
Given a CNF $\phi $ we wish to remove (some) redundant clauses. A
clause $C\in\phi$ is {\em redundant}, if and only if
$\phi\smallsetminus\{C\}\Rightarrow C$. Equivalently, a clause $C$ is
redundant if and only if $\phi\smallsetminus\{C\}\land\lnot C$ is
unsatisfiable. The latter formulation is more amenable for computation
using a SAT oracle.

This program tries to compute some redundant clauses by computing the
{\em backbone} of the formula.  We say that a literal $l$ is part of a
backbone if and only if $l$ is true in all models of the formula,
i.e.\ $\phi\Rightarrow l$. Equivalently, a literal $l$ is a backbone
iff $\phi\land\bar l$ is unsatisfiable. Again, this formulation is
more amenable for SAT-based computations.

\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:redundancy}
  Let $\phi$ be a CNF and $\psi\subseteq\phi$ such that
  $\psi\Rightarrow l$ for some literal $l$. The following set $R$ of
  clauses is redundant:
\[
    R=\comprehension{C\in\phi}{l\in C\land C\notin\psi}
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Since~$R$ is disjoint from $\psi$, it holds for an clause $C\in R$
  that $\phi\smallsetminus\{C\}\Rightarrow l$. Because $l\in C$, then
also $\phi\smallsetminus\{C\}\Rightarrow C$.
\end{proof}

The objective is to compute backbones of the given formula and remove
redundant clauses based on \autoref{proposition:redundancy}.

Note that all the above also holds for an unsatisfiable $\phi$ but it
is not likely to be useful.

\section{Public Interface}

The program should be usable as a separate module, so we declare a
class that stores the required functionality.

<<BBRed.hh>>=
#ifndef BBRED_HH_7380
#define BBRED_HH_7380
<<Definitions and includes>>
class BBRed {
public:<<Public members>>
private:<<Private members>>
};
<<Inline implementation>>
#endif

<<BBRed.cc>>=
#include "BBRed.hh"
<<Implementation>>

@ We use some types declared in the parent project. Mainly needed just
for the definition of [[CNF]], which we are getting on the input.
<<Definitions and includes>>=
#include "types.hh"

@ To use the class, one constructs it giving it the CNF to analyze and
then calls [[run]]. After [[run]] finished,
the function [[is_redundant(i)]] is used to inquire whether the clause
[[cnf[i]]] is redundant, for [[i]] s.t.\ $0\leq{}$[[i]]${}<{}$[[cnf.size]].
<<Public members>>=
BBRed(Var max_id, const CNF& cnf);
void run();
inline bool is_redundant(size_t clause_index) const;
inline size_t get_redundant_count() const;

@ \section{Data Structures}

\subsection{CNF Inversion}

As betrayed by \autoref{proposition:redundancy}, we will need to be
able to find clauses that contain a given literal. So we need a map
from literals to clauses. since this probably will not be an
efficiency bottleneck, we will use directly a map from literals to
vectors of clause indices. For the purpose of mapping literals are
translated to integers by the function [[Minisat::toInt]].

<<Definitions and includes>>=
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using std::unordered_map;
using std::vector;

<<Private members>>=
unordered_map<int, vector<size_t> > lit2index;

@ The data structure [[lit2index]] shall be populated when the class
is being constructed using the following method.

<<Private members>>=
bool inverted;
void invert(const CNF& cnf);

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::invert(const CNF& cnf) {
  assert(!inverted);
  for (size_t clause_index = 0; clause_index<cnf.size(); ++clause_index) {
    const LitSet& clause = cnf[clause_index];     
    FOR_EACH(itl, clause) {
      const Lit l = *itl;
      const int il = Minisat::toInt(l);
      const auto i = lit2index.find(il);
      if (i==lit2index.end()) {
        lit2index[il].push_back(clause_index);
      } else {
        i->second.push_back(clause_index);
      }
    }
  }
  inverted=true;
}

@ The following function is used to retrieve clause indices that
contain the given literal. Note that this implementation is ugly
because if [[lit2index]] is updated the returned pointer might become
invalid. Since a literal might not appear in the formula, we declare a
constant [[empty_vector]] that is to be returned for such cases.

<<Private members>>=
const vector<size_t>& contain(const Lit l);
const vector<size_t> empty_vector;

<<Implementation>>=
const vector<size_t>& BBRed::contain(const Lit l) {
  assert(inverted);
  const int il = Minisat::toInt(l);
  const auto i = lit2index.find(il);
  if (i==lit2index.end()) return empty_vector;
  return i->second;
}

@ \subsection{CNF Representation and Unsatisfiable Cores}

The premise of \autoref{proposition:redundancy} is that if for for the
given CNF $\phi$, if $l$ is a backbone, i.e.\ $\phi\Rightarrow l$ or
equivalently, $\phi\land\bar l$ is unsatisfiable. In order to utilize
\autoref{proposition:redundancy} we also want to find a CNF
$\psi\subseteq\phi$ s.t.\ $\psi\Rightarrow l$ or equivalently,
$\psi\land\bar l$ is unsatisfiable.

In practice this means that if $\psi\land\bar l$ is unsatisfiable, we
also want to know the {\em unsatisfiable core} of $\psi\land\bar l$,
i.e.\ the set of clauses responsible for the unsatisfiability.  For
such we will use the assumption-based method, which means that each
clause $C\in\phi$ will be given to the SAT solver as $\lnot s_C\lor
C$, for some fresh variable $s_C$. Whenever the SAT solver is invoked,
it is called with the assumptions $s_C$. The set of assumptions
responsible for the unsatisfiability will appear in the last {\em
  conflict clause} of the SAT solver and determine an unsatisfiable
core.

The variables $s_C$ are called {\em control variables}. When we
discovered that a clause is redundant, we effectively delet it by
adding a unit clause $\lnot s_C$. If this happens, such $s_C$ must not
be given in the assumptions.

The control variables will be stored in an array [[controls]] adhering
to the invariant the control variable for the clause with index [[i]]
is at [[controls[i]]]. We also have a map that maps control variables
back to clause indices.

<<Private members>>=
vector<Var> controls;
unordered_map<Var, size_t> control2index;

@ Since we do not need to remember the formula that are operating on
(we only need the inverse of it), we populate the safety solver and
the relevant structures in one go.

<<Private members>>=
Solver solver;
void fill_controls_and_sat(Var maxid, const CNF& cnf);

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::fill_controls_and_sat(Var maxid, const CNF& cnf) {
  while (solver.nVars() <= max_id) solver.newVar();
  assert(solver.nVars()>max_id); // variable 0 is not used
  vec<Lit> lv;
  for (size_t clause_index = 0; clause_index<cnf.size(); ++clause_index) {
    const LitSet& clause = cnf[clause_index];
    const Var control_variable = solver.newVar();
    lv.clear();
    lv.push(~mkLit(control_variable));
    FOR_EACH(itl, clause) lv.push(*itl);
    solver.addClause_(lv);

    controls[clause_index] = control_variable;
    control2index[control_variable] = clause_index;
  }
}

@ \subsection{Construction and Getters}

<<Private members>>=
const Var max_id;
vector<bool> redundant;
size_t redundant_count;

<<Implementation>>=
BBRed::BBRed(Var max_id, const CNF& cnf)
: inverted(false)
, controls(cnf.size(), 0)
, max_id(max_id)
, redundant(cnf.size(), false)
, redundant_count(0)
{
  invert(cnf);
  fill_controls_and_sat(max_id, cnf);
}

<<Inline implementation>>=
inline bool BBRed::is_redundant(size_t clause_index) const {
  return redundant[clause_index];
}

<<Inline implementation>>=
inline size_t BBRed::get_redundant_count() const {
  return redundant_count;
}

@ \section{Computation}

Throw the competition we use two sets of literals [[might_be]] and
[[must_be]].  The set [[might_be]] contains a literal iff we do not
know yet whether it is a backbone or not.  Conversely, the literal is
in the set [[must_be]] iff it has been shown to be a
backbone. Consequently, the two sets must be disjoint. Since these
sets will be accessed to many times, they will be represented as
bitsets.

<<Definitions and includes>>=
#include "LitBitSet.hh"

@ The algorithm initializes the set [[might_be]] and leaves
[[must_be]] empty. Then it loops while the set
[[might_be]] is nonempty. In each iteration it picks some literal
[[to_test]] from [[might_be]] an tests whether it is a backbone or
not.

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::run() {
 LitBitSet might_be;
 LitBitSet must_be;
 initialize_might_be(might_be);

 vec<Lit> assumptions;
 while (might_be.size()) {
   const Lit to_test = *(might_be.begin());
   assumptions.clear();
   build_assumptions(to_test, assumptions);
   const bool isbb = !solver.solve(assumptions);
   if (isbb) handle_backbone(might_be, must_be, to_test, solver.conflict);
   else prune_might_be(might_be,solver.model,to_test);
 }
}

@ Even though it would be correct to initialize [[might_be]] to all
possible literals we also take this opportunity to test whether the
given instance is satisfiable or not. Hence this function first tests
the satisfiability of the given formula and then initializes [[might_be]]
accordingly. If the instance is {\em satisfiable}, only those literals that
appear in the returned model can be backbones. If the instance is
unsatisfiable, [[might_be]] is populated with all possible literals on the
variables [[1..maxid]].

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::initialize_might_be(LitBitSet& might_be) {
 vec<Lit> assumptions;
 FOR_EACH(ci,controls) assumptions.push(mkLit(*ci));
 const bool is_sat = solver.solve(assumptions);

 if (is_sat) {
   const auto& model = solver.model;
   const Var limit = std::min(model.size(),max_id+1);
   for (int i=1; i<limit; ++i) {
     const auto val = model[i];
     if (val==l_Undef) continue;
     might_be.add(val==l_True ? mkLit(i) : ~mkLit(i));
   }
 } else {
   for (Var i=1; i<=max_id; ++i) {
     might_be.add(mkLit(i));
     might_be.add(~mkLit(i));
   }
 }
}

@ Recalled that to determine whether [[to_test]] is a backbone of
$\phi$, we determine the satisfiability of
$\phi\land\lnot{}$[[to_test]].  In our setup, however, things are
little bit more complicated because within the SAT solver each clause
is conditioned by its control variable. So we throw into the
assumptions the negation of [[to_test]] but also control variables of
clauses that are not marked as redundant.

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::build_assumptions(Lit to_test, vec<Lit>& assumptions) {
  for (size_t cl_index=0; cl_index<controls.size(); ++cl_index) {
    if (!is_redundant(cl_index))
      assumptions.push(mkLit(controls[cl_index]));
  }
  assumptions.push(~to_test);
}

@ If [[to_test]] is found {\em not} to be a backbone, a model
containing [[to_test]] is also returned. Remove from [[might_be]] all
literals that do not appear in this model. The literal [[[to_test]] is
given for sanity-check reasons.

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::prune_might_be(LitBitSet& might_be, const vec<lbool>& model, Lit to_test) {
  assert((var(to_test)>=model.size) ||
         !sign(to_test) || model[var(to_test)]!=l_True);
  assert((var(to_test)>=model.size) ||
         sign(to_test) || model[var(to_test)]!=l_False);

  const Var limit = std::min(model.size(),max_id+1);
  for (int i=1; i<limit; ++i) {
     const auto val = model[i];
     if (val!=l_True) might_be.remove(mkLit(i));
     if (val!=l_False) might_be.remove(~mkLit(i));
  }

}

@ If a literal [[bb]] is found to be a backbone, the SAT solver gives
us a conflict clause containing assumptions responsible for [[bb]]
being a backbone. The following function constructs an UNSAT core
based off this conflict clause and marks all clauses that contain
[[bb]] but are outside of this core as redundant. The sets
[[might_be]] and [[must_be]] updated accordingly.

<<Private members>>=
void handle_backbone(
  LitBitSet& might_be, LitBitSet& must_be,
  Lit bb, const vec<Lit>& conflict);

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::handle_backbone(
  LitBitSet& might_be, LitBitSet& must_be,
  Lit bb, const vec<Lit>& conflict) {
  assert(might_be.get(bb));
  assert(!must_be.get(bb));
  might_be.remove(bb);
  must_be.add(bb);

  vector<bool> core(controls.size(),false);
  build_core(conflict, core, bb);

  const auto& bb_clauses = contain(bb);
  FOR_EACH(cit,bb_clauses) {
    const size_t clause_index = *cit;
    if (!core[clause_index])
      mark_redundant(clause_index);
  }
}

@ Once we find out that a clause is redundant, we mark it as redundant
in the [[redundant]] set and also effectively remove it from the SAT
solver by setting its control variable to false. Note that we need to
check whether this clause has not already been found redundant before
because a clause may contain multiple backbones.

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::mark_redundant(size_t clause_index) {
  assert(clause_index<controls.size());
  if (redundant[clause_index]) return; //already known redundant
  ++redundant_count;
  redundant[clause_index] = true;
  solver.addClause(~mkLit(controls[clause_index]));
}


@ The following function is used to construct an UNSAT core given a
final conflict clause of the SAT solver. The function is also given
the backbone literal [[bb_lit]] found by this call Because it might
appear in the core. In fact, if the given instance is satisfiable, it
{\em must} appear in the core.

<<Implementation>>=
void BBRed::build_core(const vec<Lit>& conflict, vector<bool>& core, Lit bb_lit) {
  assert(core.size()==controls.size());
  for (int i=0; i<conflict.size(); ++i) {
    const Lit reason = conflict[i];
    if (bb_lit==reason) continue;
    assert(sign(reason));
    const auto i = control2index.find(var(reason));
    assert(i!=control2index.end());
    core[i->second]=true;
  }
}
